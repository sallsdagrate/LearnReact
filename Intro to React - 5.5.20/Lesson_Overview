Here's what we covered:
- React allows us to essentially make our own HTML tags, remove duplicating code, and put HTML, CSS and JS in a single file
- writing a simple functional component
- using the useState hook
- components re-render when their state or props change
- components are like functions
- the attributes of your component are like the function arguments; we call them props
- emotion is a library that allows you to write "CSS-in-JS"
- the old way of using state: by using a class component
- in the old way, we explicitly declare this.state ONLY in the constructor, to change it elsewhere we use setState which rerenders the component
